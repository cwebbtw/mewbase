# mewbase
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tesco/mewbase.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Tesco/mewbase)

Mewbase is an eventing toolkit of the JVM. Events are one of the fundamental building blocks when developing a [Reactive System](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/). Designing and building a system based on events typically involves decomposing the system using techniques such as [event storming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPseA_3UOMk), and there a number of patterns and techniques in which a system can slowly adapt to be more event driven. The goal of mewbase is to provide a number of general purpose patterns and implementations to make both building, migrating and moving to and between event driven systems simple, and without being prescriptive around underlying infrastructure requirements.

Such examples of patterns used when moving to an event based architecture include:

* Event emitting of changes in a system (typically backed by underlying messaging infrastructure - though mewbase tries to standardise access APIs across providers).
* Subscribing and responding events.
* Separating commands and queries (i.e. [CQRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation)).

Examples of streams of events might be:

* Shopping basket events (add/remove/order) from a website
* Events from IoT sensors
* Stock movement events in a supply chain

These events often need to be persisted fast and in high volume and potentially stored for very long periods of time. 

Storing logs of events provides many advantages including:

* Complete audit trail of everything that happened
* Events can be replayed for back-testing or debugging
* Analytics can be run on the events to extract business value
* Machine learning models can be trained in the events to do all sorts of funky stuff
* Events can be used to co-ordinate busines processes between different services
* Functions can be used to implement distributed eventually consistent transactions

Many applications typically want to deal with *aggregated* event data, not the raw event data. Examples would
include:

* A website wants to see the *current* state of a shopping basket, not deal with the raw add/remove item events
* A report needs to display average temperature from IoT sensors broken down by region in real-time
* A stock inventory needs to maintain current stock of products per warehouse
* A business process/saga needs to listen to events and maintain state

### Getting started 

The best starting point is by [locally installing Mewbase](https://github.com/Tesco/mewbase/blob/master/docs/resources.md), before moveing on the the introductory guide or code examples which is linked too below.

[This introduction](https://github.com/Tesco/mewbase/blob/master/docs/introduction.md) provides a solid foundation of main components of a Mewbase system.

To get straight into the code examples, there are a number of [Java code examples here](https://github.com/Tesco/mewbase/tree/master/examples-java/src/main/java/example).
